# Logs

If you are having problems with TV Rename or maybe someone on the [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tvrename) has asked you about the content of your log file you have a couple of options…

If you are happy navigating through the windows file structure the log file (TVRename.log) can be found in: -

> \Users\\\<username>\AppData\Roaming\TV Rename\log\\

However, if you are uncomfortable doing this there is a handy entry in the **Help** menu (**Help>Log**).

This will either “tee” the log data (as it happens) into a new window so you can read it or copy the relevant bits for pasting in a [forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tvrename) message.

_To use this feature click **Help>Log** first and then run the action (a Scan for example) you wish to monitor/capture._

Optionally, if you wish to view the entire log file clicking the `View Full Log` button in the bottom right corner of the window will open the file in Notepad.

More detailed information about the logs can be found in the [Technical Guide](https://www.tvrename.com/manual/technical#log-files).

**Good to know:** depending on the product you're building, it can be useful to explicitly document use cases. Got a product that can be used by a bunch of people in different ways? Maybe consider splitting it out!
