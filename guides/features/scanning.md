# Scanning

**Scan Types**

There are 4 types of scan:

* _Single Show_ – A single show can be scanned manually.
* _Quick Scan_ - A ‘clever’ scan that looks in the download directory for shows to scan. It also scans missing episodes from the recent list.
* _Recent Scan_ – A scan that looks at all shows that have had an episode aired in the last few days. The number of days can be specified in the preferences.
* _Full Scan_ – Scans all shows that are set to be scanned.

**Triggering Scans**

These can be triggered in several ways:

* On Startup
* Via Command Line
* Periodic (Automated)
* When download/search folder/file changes
* Manually
