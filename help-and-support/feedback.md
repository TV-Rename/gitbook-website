## Questions & Issues

Your starting point for discussing any questions, issues and bugs should be the [TV Rename Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tvrename). Here you can search to see if the question or issue has been raised before, if you can’t find a solution to your conundrum just create a “NEW TOPIC” and ask away.

A number of people (including the developers) keep a “weather eye” here, it shouldn’t be too long before you get a response. If requested please pack up your configuration files and send them to us, this will help with the diagnosis (see the [“Technical Guide”](../the-manual/technical-guide/logs-and-configuration.md) for details).

**For security reasons it is advisable to only send the log/configuration package to the person helping you with your problem**.

## &#x20;Reporting Bugs

If you’ve found a bug that has been verified, please make sure it has been raised on the [GitHub Bug Tracker](https://github.com/TV-Rename/tvrename/issues). Once it’s there it will definitely get the developers attention (and hopefully a quick response).&#x20;

## Requests for New Ideas & Features

If you have an idea for a great new feature you can post it on our “[Idea Wall](http://ideas.theideawall.com/TVRename/Forum/Details/8dea3275-4010-4bab-9763-a8bb613517e0)” (as well as discussing it in the forum). Apart from suggesting new features, the Idea Wall lets you comment and vote on other ideas and suggestions.
