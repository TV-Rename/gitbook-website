# Questions, Issues & Bugs

Your starting point for discussing any questions, issues and bugs should be the [TV Rename Forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/tvrename). Here you can search to see if the question or issue has been raised before, if you can’t find a solution to your conundrum just create a “NEW TOPIC” and ask away.

A number of people (including the developers) keep a “weather eye” here, it shouldn’t be too long before you get a response.

If you’ve found a bug that has been verified, please make sure it has been raised on the [GitHub Bug Tracker](https://github.com/TV-Rename/tvrename/issues). Once it’s there it will definitely get the developers attention (and hopefully a quick response). If requested please pack up your configuration files and send them to us, this will help with the diagnosis (see the [“Technical Guide”](https://www.tvrename.com/manual/technical#configuration-files) for details).

**For security reasons it is advisable to only send the package to the person helping you with your problem**.
