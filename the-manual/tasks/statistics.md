Statistics provides you with a high level summary of the content of the TV Rename database.

This statistics illustration (left) was created a few weeks after a fresh install of TV Rename was carried out (so work on updating the documentation could begin with a clean setup).

It’s surprising just how much work TV Rename does just “managing some videos”.

**Note:** “Episodes on disk:” may show a question mark instead of a value. Because this field takes a relatively long time to calculate a value is only displayed once a full scan has been completed.
