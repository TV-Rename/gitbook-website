### Frameworks <a href="#framework" id="framework"></a>

#### Winforms C# application

TV Rename uses the Microsoft .NET Framework. The installer will check for its presence and let you know if any action is needed. It’s a free download from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/windows).

#### .NET Framework 4.8



#### C++

The app will check on this and ask the user to upgrade if it's missing. It's needed as a dependency for CEF Framework
