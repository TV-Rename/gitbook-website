# Clean Up Empty Library Folders

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

TV Rename will create folders as seasons get announced and sometimes it will not remove unused movie folders. 'Clean Up Empty Library Folders' scans though:

* Base folder for each TV show and Movie in the library
* Movie Library Folders (and subfolders)
* TV Show Library Folders (and subfolders)

It shows the results of the scan in the Scan results screen and they can be activated by clicking on 'Do Checked',

{% hint style="danger" %}
Make sure you **double check** the folders it is proposing to remove. It considers a folder to be empty if it contains no video files. It does not check that they are not important for any other reasons.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Note: The next scan may recreate some of the empty folders. If you have a season that has been announced, but no episodes aired yet then the folder will be (re)created
{% endhint %}
