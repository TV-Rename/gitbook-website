# Find Merged Episodes

![Duplicate Episode Finder](https://www.tvrename.com/assets/images/tools/duplicate-episode-finder-01.png)

The Duplicate Episode Finder will identify files in your library that contain two episodes of a show but do not have not had a merge rule applied…

Key things that might indicate this are: -

1. The two episodes on TVDB have the same air date.
2. The names of the episodes are similar.
3. One of the episodes has been matched to a file and the other has not.
4. The matched file is around twice the size of another for the same show.

If all (or some) of these criteria are met it’s probable that the file on disk actually represents both episodes.

Right clicking on an entry displays some options and the ability to auto-create the merge rule.
