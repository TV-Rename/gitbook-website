The recommendation feature asks TMDB for information about which other shows/movies are similar or related to items in your existing library. The scan takes a while, but when it completes you can:

1. Use the list view on the left to filter and sort the possible recommendations. (right click on the column headers for options)
2. Enter the preferences to adjust the weightings provided to the 4 categories of suggestions (above)
3. Review a preview of the recommended show/movie

{% hint style="info" %}
The Quality Rating in the interface is a measure of 'star rating' on TMDB and 'Recommendation %' is a measure of how much the show/movie is 'linked' to your library.
{% endhint %}

If you are interested you can right-click on the recommendation to quickly add it to your library&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: As TMDB is used as the only source, only movies / TV shows with a TMDB id will be used to calculate the recommendations
